### Stock Market Analysis  

Steve approached our team with a request for continued analysis of twelve specific stocks in which he sought to understand more deeply. Steve provided the years and list of targeted stocks and our team went from there. 

## Analysis and Challenges

This is the second project we have worked on for Steve. The first project was specific to one stock, DQ. Steve has been assisting his parents on selecting the best investment opportunity and their understanding of that specific stock performance was favorable. 

After further review of DQ's performance over the last two fiscal years (2017 and 2018), data showed that DQ, in fact, was not a favorable stock as it related to ROI. Futher, with a -63% return from 2017 to 2018, Steve quickly pivoted and requested the second project - an analysis of twelve specific stocks. 

The first analysis (DQ stock, only), was fairly straight forward. However, with the request to analyze eleven more ticker performances, the scope broadened. At that point, our team decided to refactor our code for a couple of reasons: one being our data set had changed and two, we needed to tighen up our code to encompass nearly 11x the data. 

We explained to Steve that the project would take a few more hours and he was amenable. As well, in refactoring the code for project two, we were able to get faster run times when analyze the date, giving us all a gain of seconds in our day, which to be honest, seconds count - do they not? They do.

### Portfolio Analysis

Overall, 2017 was a banner year for the list as it relates to Return. However, when comparing the same list to the following year, 2018 proved to be dismal on the Return side with all but two stocks resulting in unfavorable returns (sad).

If our business was financial advising, which it is not and our legal team would strongly *advise us* to avoid any and all unsolicited opinions - especially in matters towards one's financial decisions (literally, they said, *Please, stick to data and leave your opinions to yourselves.*) - we would say leave ten of the stocks alone and pursue RUN and ENPH if you want a chance at any return on those hard-earned dollars. Again, just our opinion and that opinion is strickly anonymous.

### To Refactor or Not To Refactor? 

The legal team said we could talk about this. 

Refactoring the code for Steven's second project was fun and functional. Some may argue this point (like those who don't know very much about important things like the benefits of refactoring every chance you have), but here are the official Top Three Benefits of Refactoring Code (in no specific order, unless you want thme to be):

1. Refactoring tightens up the ship. It removes redunancies and complexities of code.  
2. Enhances reliablity of the code because of the first reason: less complexities = simplicity = understanability and clarity. 
3. Strengthens the code and in return, less bugs. And may we add, less bugs means more efficiency on the team which the Budget Overseers always applaud. Win! 

As we noted, some naysayers will chime in about refactoring and say it's unneccessary. Here are three reasons why one might say that: 

1. Refactoring means you sometimes have to rebake the cake and that takes time depedning on the need or recipe. We are being metaphorical here because metaphors keep life interesting. 
2. Because time is money, this can add cost to multiple areas of the team and/or distract from other initiatives or projects. And frankly some people (clients, especially) don't want to spend more time if it works in the first place. 
3. When code is refactored, it has been said that you may get lost and not know where to go from... there. May we suggest clean code, organization and a good night's sleep to avoid these common pitfalls. Afterall, all things are subject to improvement, no?
